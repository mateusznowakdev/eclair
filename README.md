# EclairM0

[Project description](https://mateusznowak.dev/eclair) and [build instructions](https://mateusznowak.dev/eclair/build) can be found on my website.

Hardware files can be previewed in these third-party web applications:

- KiCad files (board) -- https://kicanvas.org
- OpenSCAD files (enclosure) -- https://openscad.cloud/openscad/

License terms for software and hardware are present in the [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) file.

## Building firmware from source

Install the TinyGo SDK. Copy EclairM0 board definition files as follows:

| File from this repo                | Target SDK directory |
|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| firmware/_board/board_eclair-m0.go | src/machine          |
| firmware/_board/eclair-m0.json     | targets              |
| firmware/_board/eclair-m0.ld       | targets              |

Now you should be able to build and upload new firmware, like this:

```bash
cd firmware
tinygo flash -target eclair-m0 -size short
```

## Updating font data

Font data is stored in the `tools/newstroke.pbm` image file, with `tools/newstroke.txt` containing font widths. The image file can be edited in GIMP.

These source files can be converted into a working Go code, using the `tools/convert.py` script, which should work with any modern version of Python:

```bash
cd tools
python convert.py newstroke.pbm newstroke.txt > ../firmware/hal/display/font.go
```

## 3D-printing the enclosure

Creality Ender-3 V3 KE is my 3D printer. I'm using OrcaSlicer 2.2.0 and at this point I'm too scared to update :)

These are the printing settings recommended by me:

- Global filament settings &rarr; 215&deg;C nozzle, 60&deg;C bed
  - give the bed extra time to actually warm up
- "0.12mm Fine" base preset
- Quality &rarr; Seam position: BACK
- Quality &rarr; Scarf joint seam: CONTOUR
- Quality &rarr; Precise wall: ON
- Quality &rarr; Walls printing order: INNER/OUTER
- Quality &rarr; Detect overhang walls: OFF
- Strength &rarr; Bottom surface pattern: ARCHIMEDEAN or HILBERT for best appearance
- Speed &rarr; First layer: 20mm/s (default is 50mm/s and it's too fast)
- Based on calibration results, the very center of the heatbed may not give the best results

## Engraving button labels

Gerber files generated by KiCad can be converted to a G-code compatible with many desktop CNCs. If you happen to use `pcb2gcode`, the example config is available in the repo.
